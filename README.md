# ESIN Project: Word Challenge  

This project involves the implementation of various modules and classes in **C++** to create a word game inspired by popular games like **Scrabble** or **Word Challenge**. The goal of the game is to form valid words from a limited set of letters, focusing on optimizing performance and efficient data structures.  

## Project Overview  

- **Objective:** Implement a modular system to generate all valid words from a given set of letters according to a dictionary.  
- **Features:**  
  - Efficient algorithms to find valid word combinations.  
  - Classes and modules for handling anagrams, subsets, and word validation.  
  - Adherence to a modular design with reusable components.  

## Key Components  

1. **`word_toolkit` Module:**  
   Provides utility functions to assist other classes and modules.  

2. **Dictionary Class:**  
   Handles storage, retrieval, and pattern matching of words.  

3. **Anagrams Class:**  
   Extends the dictionary to efficiently find all words with the same canonical anagram.  

4. **Subset Iterator Class:**  
   Implements an iterator to generate all subsets of a given size from a set of elements.  

5. **`obte_paraules` Module:**  
   Offers functions to retrieve all valid words from a set of letters.  

## Usage  

This project is designed to work on **GNU/Linux** systems using the **g++ 13.2.0** compiler.

## Requirements  

- **C++ Compiler:** GNU g++ 13.2.0.  
- **Development Environment:** Linux (recommended for compatibility with the evaluation system).
